                There are a number of reasons you may need a block of text and when
                you do, a random paragraph can be the perfect solution. If you happen
                to be a web designer and you need some random text to show in your
                layout, a random paragraph can be an excellent way to do this.
            </p>

                If you're a programmer and you need random text to test the program,
                using these paragraphs can be the perfect way to do this. Anyone who's
                in search of realistic text for a project can use one or more of these
                random paragraphs to fill their need.
